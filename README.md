Programming in .NET

Course Description:
This course focuses on how to design, develop, and implement interactive and user-friendly software within the Microsoft .NET environment. An object-oriented approach to programming is used to develop both console and GUI applications. Core topics covered expand upon the concepts of classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Program designs may incorporate interfaces, data structures, and/or generic collections. Where used, Windows forms will introduce the concept of event-driven programming, touching on form navigation, data entry validation, and database processing.
